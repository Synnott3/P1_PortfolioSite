<h1 align="center">P1 - Portfolio Site For AdamSynnott.com</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://synnott3.github.io/P1_PortfolioSite/)

This will be the foundation of a future portfilo site that I will be using to host and display future coding projects, along side passed photography work, in this example and for P1 it will be just the photography work, using HTML, CSS as well as some JavaScript libraries. 

This will be a one page site, with a fixed colour palette throughout the site, that using bootstrape framework it will be fully reactive on all screen szies and devices.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories 

#### First Time Visitor Goals 

- It would be set up so that potential employers could see my work at a glance.
- It would become a show case of my best work, and not just a backlog of work.
- A place where I could have an online presence that any user may be able to view my work.
- Also for first time vistors it would become a testimonial of my work as well as proof of my ability.
- Become an online business card for contact and bookings with pass or future clients.

#### Returning Visitor Goals 

- For employers to see that I have kept up my work and skills that have improved over the years.
- For a followering of people who may enjoy my photography as well as my future coding work a place for them to see how my work has changede and evolved over the years.
- A place for passed clients to be able to contact me for future work.
- A hub of communications for on going work.

#### Frequent User Goals 
- Frequent users goals with this site would mainly be a place for clients to be able to come by for more work in the future, or updates on current work.
- To see how my skills and projects are working both finished and ongoing.
- If in a job hiring stage it may be a good point of references that may put me ahead of other hirers also going for the same job.


## Design

### Colour Scheme 
- There will be four many colours used throughout the site I have picked these based on a simple colour flow that has a slight pop to draw attention to important factors of the site e.g Nav Bar and contact page. (See screenshot below of colours used)

 ![](assets/docs/ColoursForSite.PNG)

 - The whole site will also only be a single page site, with a simple title at the top followed by my work, which will be clickable using JS Lightbox (will go into more details in the technologies used section) and finally with a contact form at the bottom.

### Typography
- There will be one front throughout the site and that will be the google railroad font at 300 weight so very light and easy on the eyes for phone disply but won't take away from the gallery which is the main focus. 

 ### Imagery 
 - All imagery used will be of my own work. 
 - It is set up in such a way that images and work can be added very easily in time and always kept up to date.
 
## Wireframe 

See below for wireframe layout of site using Balsmiq, with a mobile first design as well as desktop layout.
